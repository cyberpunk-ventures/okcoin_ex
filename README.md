# OkcoinEx

WIP. Alpha. Elixir wrapper for OkCoin API.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed as:

  1. Add ex_blocktrail to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

        def deps do
          [{:okcoin_ex, "~> 0.0.1"}]
        end

  2. Ensure ex_blocktrail is started before your application:

        def application do
          [applications: [:okcoin_ex]]
        end
